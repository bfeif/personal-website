      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning my next language (Hebrew), and I found myself wondering something that most language-learners probably wonder at some point: why the hell are there so many irregular verb conjugations in this language?

CURT: &amp;ldquo;Mack! Great to see you. Beautiful day for tooth-pickin&amp;rsquo;, huh?&amp;rdquo;
MACK: &amp;ldquo;You bet, Curt. To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?</description>
