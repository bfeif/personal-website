      <description>And Then There Were Numbers Sometimes, I like to imagine the moment that the Set of Natural Numbers was invented. It goes a little bit like this:
 Stage Left: Curt the Caveman walks in to Mack the Caveman&amp;rsquo;s cave; Mack is picking his teeth with a bone.
MACK: &amp;ldquo;Hey, Curt!&amp;rdquo;
CURT: &amp;ldquo;Mack! Great to see you. Beautiful day for tooth-pickin&amp;rsquo;, huh?&amp;rdquo;
MACK: &amp;ldquo;You bet, Curt. To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?</description>

      <description>Why are the Most Common Verbs Irregular? Recently, I was wondering something that most romance language learners probably wonder at some point&amp;ndash;why the hell are there so many irregular verb conjugations in this language? And why are they so weird (See: Portuguese Subjunctive of the verb &amp;lsquo;ser&amp;rsquo;)? And why, oh why, do they always happen with the most commonly used verbs (e.g. &amp;rsquo;to want&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;to do&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;to say&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;to be&amp;rsquo;)? It&amp;rsquo;s like someone purposely designed Portuguese to be hard to learn.</description>
