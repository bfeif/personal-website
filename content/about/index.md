Got data? You've come to the right place.  

I'm from the US, and I currently live in Berlin, Germany. I have a background in optical physics, and have since been working in the data field for 4+ years. I love data, science, languages, and chess; and I especially love creating web products and writing about all of them.

In my career, I've researched, built, and deployed machine learning models across a variety of operational and commercial contexts; I've researched and created business-metrics, and created invaluable dashboards to communicate those metrics to business and product people; I've helped build data-science teams; and I've mentored junior data scientists.

You should reach out to me if:
- You have a product or website that you think is ready for some data science and machine learning.
- You have a dataset that you'd like to understand more about.
- You're a small business owner and would like to understand more about your customers' buying behaviors so that you can optimize your business.
- You'd like your minimum viable product built.
- You're a young data scientist (or somebody who might like to get into the field), looking for advice on how to advance your career.
- You want to work together on a project.
