***Number 7 will surprise you, but number 10 will shock you.***

How do you learn a language? Do you use language textbooks? Music and books? Apps? Courses? Everybody does it differently, but most people have a similar goal when it comes to learning a language - *they want to build inter-cultural relationships*.\

This could be because work or opportunity brought them to a country where they don't speak the language; it could be to learn more about a culture or one's own ancestry; it could even be to get closer to one's partner's family (as is the case for me).

As stated in the movie 'Tolkien', "what is language for? It's not just the naming of things, is it? It's the lifeblood of a culture, a people." Learning a language is a journey of understanding a culture, and these 10 progressive steps will be encountered - and must be overcome - in order to do so.

1. Buy a coffee at a coffee shop.
2. Order food at a restaurant.
3. Ask somebody about their day, and ask them at least one follow-up question.
4. Explain your career or background to somebody.
5. Learn a song by heart.
6. Tell a joke that somebody laughs at.
7. Win a political or philosophical debate.

I chose these 7 social situations for very specific reasons. Read on to find out why.

## 1. Buy a Coffee at a Coffee Shop
This is level 1. You've just arrived to a new country, and you need your caffeine! This one requires just some basic vocabulary and grammar, and it doesn't test much your listening comprehension skills. It also helps that you're basically paying the cashier to listen to you. (Note: this one also works with beer, soda, or a water bottle :D)

## 2. Order Food at a Restaurant
This is similar to buying a coffee at a coffee shop, but it's a bit more complicated! For this one, you'll need to be able to read and understand a menu, and you'll need to have a bit deeper of a conversation than you had with the coffee-shop cashier.

## 3. Ask somebody about their day, and ask them at least one follow-up question.
Things are starting to get interesting now; you can be understood by cashiers, waiters, and waitresses, and that's no small feat! So people can understand you, but can you understand others? This social situation is your first tool you can use for building relationships in your target language. In order to do so, you need to be able to listen, understand, and respond.

## 4. Explain to somebody why you are learning there language.
When we meet people and unexpectedly speak to them in their mother tongue, they are usually pleasantly surprised! Especially if they can't speak our mother tongue. And so, one of the most common questions we get asked is an excited "why do you speak Portuguese/Hebrew/German?" Common questions are worth having prepared answers for; in this case, doing so will force you to discuss your background, your story, using multiple verb-tenses, and use vocabulary that is probably quite important to you (e.g. vocabulary about where you're from, what you do, important relationships, etc). This is your first step to constsructing long-form speech, and is your second tool for building relationships in your target language.

## 5. Learn a song by heart.
Learning music is a great way to learn a language, for many reasons:
- You learn the way that the language gets mapped to rhythms and melodies. In fact, for a great example of how different languages map to different rhythms, [The Girl from Ipanema](https://open.spotify.com/track/0Eir5hEgKUjm8liGGXfghF?si=6c7ff96103b5492c) has both Portuguese and English lyrics; the Portuguese chorus has many more syllables than the English chorus, among other differences.
- Textbooks will teach you the important phrases "want to" and "going to", but only music, in its slang and melodic speech, can teach you the important phrases "wanna" and "gonna".
- A song can have many cultural concepts baked into it - the approach to work, to gender identities, attitudes towards punctuality and age, and much much more. As such, just one song can teach you a surprising amount about your target language and its culture.

Learning a song by heart gives you a great way to practice your language all the time - you can sing to yourself while you're walking, while you're doing the dishes, or while you're cooking. You might even find yourself in situations the the song comes on at a party, and you can sing along just like all the native speakers (in fact, this happened to me quite recently with an Israeli song!).

Commiting a song in your target language to memory requires a moderately advanced level of listening comprehension... can you do it?

## 6. Tell a joke that somebody laughs at.









You learn [connected speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_speech), or the 'super-fast and mushed-together' accents of the native speakers. To learn more about connected speech, you can check out this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc2r_5XhkGk). In other words, English language textbooks will teach you phrases "gonnas" and "wannas" of your target language.
