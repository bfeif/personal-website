***And how to excel at each level, and transition to the next.***

It's true--when it comes to expectations of a data scientist, different companies have different data needs, different job requirements, different levelings, different engineering requirements of data scientists, different everything.  

But, cutting through all that, the same core differences sits at the separation between junior, mid-level, and senior data scientist. Are you ready? Are you sure?  

- A great **junior** data scientist can execute any solution to any data science problem.
- A great **mid-level** data scientist can come up with the solution to any data science problem and execute it.
- A great **senior** data scientist can come up with the right problem, figure out the solution, and execute it.

That's right: a junior data scientist's skill-set is a strict subset of a mid-level data scientist's skill-set, which is a strict subset of a senior data scientist's skill-set.  

In the following sections, I'll explain a little bit more about how to excel in each of the three levels, and how to transition into the next.

# How to Excel as a Junior Data Scientist

At this point in your career, you should be failing as much as you can. How many hypotheses can you test in one week? How quickly can you build as much data science intuition as possible? As a junior data-scientist, you'll make a lot of mistakes. Some common mistakes I see from junior data-scientists that I've managed include, but are not limited to: information leakage,
