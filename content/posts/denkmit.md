### Denkmit

One of the joys of learning a new language is discovering yourself in the language. Each new language is like a new color palette or musical instrument for self-expression. Everybody wields their language in a unique way; everybody has a unique voice. As I've begun to learn my next language (Hebrew), it's time to retool. There are a lot of language-learning tools out there, but I was seeking something that would cater to my specific voice, and help me to pay closer attention where I needed to. I couldn't find the right tool, so I decided to create it.  

[Denkmit](https://example.com/) creates language learning flashcards from your own WhatsApp chats. It prioritizes learning words and phrases that you and your conversation partners use most often, and that you have the most difficulty remembering. All language-learning requires some small amount of memorization, and Denkmit helps you to do that memorization as effectively as possible. It does so by teaching you your own words, while reminding you of the context in which you learned them. Denkmit helps you to learn your language, your way. Drop your email in the website to get early access to the tool ;)
