## Why are the Most Common Verbs Irregular?
Recently, I was wondering something that most romance language learners probably wonder at some point--why the hell are there so many irregular verb conjugations in this language? And why are they so weird (See: Portuguese Subjunctive of the verb 'ser')? And why, oh why, do they always happen with the most commonly used verbs (e.g. 'to want', 'to do', 'to say', 'to be')? It's like someone purposely designed Portuguese to be hard to learn.

So, I started researching this question, and came across an interesting hypothesis (thought? idea? already proven? observation? gotta research more...) by the linguist /u/bohnicz in a thread on the linguistics subreddit:

At least for [Indo-European] languages, the verbs meaning to be (usually) are the most irregular verbs in the entire language, with a so-called suppletive paradigm consisting of three or more different roots.

Just take a look at the Old High German forms of sīn 'to be': bim ~ bin : bist : ist ; birum ~ birun : birut : sind (Indicative) sī : sīst : sī ; sīn : sīt : sīn (Subjunctive) This paradigm already contains words formed from three different roots, and we havn't looked at the past tense and conditional mood yet...

Irregular verbs tend to be VERY old and highly frequent in use - being highly frequent is in fact what keeps them from becoming "regular" verbs, just like [another Reddit user] already stated.

The idea is that (in my understanding), the more frequent a word is used, the more slowly it's pronunciation and writing evolves over time in the language. Just think for a second--the word "the" is pronounced 'correctly' (correctly in the born accent, that is, even though the pronunciation doesn't differ much across accents) by almost every native English speaker, while everyone I know has an answer to the question "what's a word you had only ever read and never heard out loud and then said it for the first time when you were decently old and your pronunciation was completely wrong?". (For me, 'epilogue' was pronounced 'eh-pill-oh-gew' instead of 'eh-pill-og'.)

But this idea is so cool. I especially like /u/bohnicz's thought that "irregular verbs tend to be VERY old". It makes me feel like, when I'm saying a phrase with common verbs like "this is good", I'm reaching back into ancient civilizations and LIVING for a brief second in history books. On this note, this video does a great overview of how the verb for 'to be' evolved from Vulgar Latin into each Romance Language.

This thinking about 'verb frequency of usage' and how it might have some special relationship with irregularity (a property that we believe is directly influenced by frequency of usage) gets me thinking about Zipf's law. Zipf's law, as applied to word frequency in language, states that (from Wikipedia):
