# What's Right?
Neil DeGrasse Tyson writes that "the good thing about science is that it's right, whether or not you agree with it".

I couldn't disagree more. See, I believe that science can, at worst, prove something wrong; at better, it can prove things more right than something else; and at best, it can prove things useful. But science can never prove things absolutely right. And that's because there are always infinite testable hypotheses that might explain a given phenomenon.

Whether we realize it or not, chooseing a hypothesis to test is quite a delicate process. And with this choice, we subconsciously inflect our culture, our bias, our practice, and even our personal or financial ambitions. With each chosen hypothesis, we guide our collective understanding of the world forward. And in this way, science is an art.
