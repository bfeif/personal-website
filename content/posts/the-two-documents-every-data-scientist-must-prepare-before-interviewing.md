# The Two Most Common Interview Questions

Data science interviews can be notoriously tough.

As data scientists, we can be expected to serve a sort of swiss-army knife function between business intelligence, software engineering, machine learning, data analysis, and product. Each company uses data scientists differently, and their interviews reflect that. As such, depending on the interview, we need to be prepared to answer prompts on statistics, machine learning, ab testing, business intelligence, system design, leetcode style programming questions, and more... 

...but in this ocean of possible prompts, there are two prompts that come up in almost every single data science interview:
- Tell me about yourself.
- Tell me about a project you've worked on.

These questions are so common, that we have no excuse not to crush it every time. And the best way to ensure that you crush it every time is to write your answers preemptively, a separate document for each. After all, verbal communication is just improvised writing.

I have given many data scientists (both those trying to get into the job for the first time and those looking for a new role) this advice, and they consistently say that this is the most useful interview advice they've ever received.

In this article, I'll tell you about how I write each of the "Tell Me About Yourself" and "Tell Me About a Project" documents and about how I use them in interviews, so that you too can benefit!

# Tell Me About Yourself
## How to Write it
We've all heard it: "So, what brings you to (insert company name)?"; "Before jumping into the interview, why don't you take some time to tell me a little bit more about your background?". What they're really asking is "please read your resume to me".

The answer to this question is best given chronologically, so do it! Write a bullet for each step on your resume, describing:
- How you got into the position.
- What you did during the position, describing any key technologies, domains, or projects you worked in.
- Why you left.

Your answer to "Tell Me About Yourself" shouldn't be more than two minutes or so, and you want to use that time wisely. So, for stuff early in your career, you should write less; and as you get closer to your current position, you should write more.

For your most recent bullet point (i.e. your current experience), when answering the "Why you left" part, this is where you want to write a little bit about the company you're interviewing for. What interests you in them? How do they fit into your story, and how do you fit into theirs?

## How to Use it

I usually have my desktop split half and half: one side has the interview video call open, and the other side has this document open. When the interviewer asks me their version of "Tell Me About Yourself", I say something like "Sure! I'll tell you about my background chronologically, which is bottom to top on my resume". That way, the interviewer can use my resume as a visual tool for orienting themselves in my narrative.

Furthermore, depending on the company, your interviewer, and the vibe of the interview, you can shorten or lengthen bullet points, and even omit earlier bullet points altogether.

# Tell Me About A Project You've Worked On
## How to Write It
The first thing you should do is choose a project. It can be a school project, a work project, a personal project, or something else. You want something as recent as possible, where you've done as much work as possible and taken a lot of ownership.

Once you've chosen a project, you should describe it in the following three sections:
- What was the problem you needed to solve?
- What was your solution?
- Answers to common questions.

Both the problem and the solution should be quantitative wherever possible (e.g. impact estimations, training measurements, added business value, etc). But the real secret sauce is in the "Answers to common questions" section. Here are some examples of questions that I have in my own "Answers to common questions" section:
- What did you learn in the discovery phase?
- How did you deploy your model? Why did you deploy this way?
- What was the impact?
- Did you AB test? How did you iterate after AB testing?
- Why did you choose the model that you chose?
- You used LightGBM for your system--how does LightGBM work? How is it different from XGBoost?

As the old adage instructs, "if it's on your resume, be prepared to answer questions about it". Likewise, "if you used a technology or tool in your work, be prepared for questions about them". As such, writing this document is a great studying and interview-preparation tool for me. I make sure I know my projects inside and out, at a high level and at a low level.

## How to Use it

Like with the "Tell Me About Yourself" document, I have this one open alongside the interview video call screen. When they say "tell me about a project", I deliver my "problem" and "solution" section. Then, when they start with their questions, I reference my notes: if it's a question I've got a response for, I can mostly read it off (or just glance at it to jog my memory--I don't want to sound too much like a broken record); if they ask a question that I've never gotten, then I do my best, and make sure to include that question (and my answer) to the section before my next interview. It's that simple.

# Conclusion

Everybody interviews differently, this is just my two-cents. But I will say, that writing these documents has helped me to have a **100% conversion rate on both the phone-screen interview and the first interview**. Having answers to these questions prepared in clean documents simply gives you two less things to think about, and allows you to focus on building a relationship with your interviewer and on the hard questions that matter more.
